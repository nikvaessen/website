## About me

I am a nerd, first and foremost, someone who likes to tinker with computers and software.
I have an interest in board games, video games, and science fiction stories in book and video format :).

Here's a list of my favourites:

* Board games: Dune: Imperium, Terraforming Mars, Hanabi
* Video games: DotA 2, Portal 2, FTL: faster than light
* TV series: Mr Robot, Better Call Saul, House of Cards (s1 and s2)
* Books: The Stormlight Archive, The Expanse, Harry Potter, <small>Game of Thrones, The Kingkiller Chronicle</small>

I am in the process of obtaining a PhD from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl).
